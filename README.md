LLMs on their own are powerful, but their real value comes when they understand your intent and anticipate the next move.

The right data isn’t just sitting in a database—it’s happening in real time. Every action you take, every Reddit post you save, is a signal. Challenges of organizing your browser tab, searching for past knowledge, and getting organized should feel like a thing of the past.  

That’s what Donna does. We don’t just store information—we help LLMs connect the dots, figure out what matters right now and guide you to the next step.

## Demo

### Home Page

- I also need to purchase new running shoes for myself, which we know from browser history.
- Have a few uncategorized items on the home page.
- Have a button to create a quick note.
- Have a button to see AI apps.

### Collection

- Understand and chat: offer chatting about valentines restaurants or something.

### Moving Fowards
It suggests two tasks:
- It hasn't seen me look for accommodations, it should suggest some based on my tastes and browsing history.
- There is a JetPurple app that can book my flights, suggest that I use it and show exactly what I will expose.
- I can also chat.

Decisions:
- Should we just use MCP or build an API platform?
